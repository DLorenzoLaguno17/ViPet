# ViPet
ViPet is a game that uses augmented reality. In it, you take care of a virtual pet, playing with him, feeding and caressing him.
You have two different sceneries to play in, depending on the tracker you use.

It has been developed by three students of the third course of the Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM: Ferran Barnes, Eric Canela and Daniel Lorenzo, using Vuforia's Unity package.
